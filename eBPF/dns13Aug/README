1. XDP program loaded and attached on enp2s0 (fd=5)

    Our compiled BPF program (dns_filter.bpf.o) was successfully loaded into the kernel.

    It is now actively running on the enp2s0 interface.

    fd=5 is the file descriptor representing the loaded program in the kernel.

    Any packets coming through enp2s0 are now being processed by our XDP program.

2. Press Enter to detach...

    The loader is waiting for you to press Enter to remove the program. This is a simple interactive way to keep the program running temporarily.

3. XDP program detached

    After pressed Enter, the loader called bpf_xdp_detach() and removed the XDP program from the interface.

    Normal packet processing on enp2s0 resumes.
